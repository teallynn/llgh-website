## Check out our available Houses!

Treat yourself to a Monroe/Brown County getaway off the beaten path. Our two Lake Lemon hideaways are all located just one mile west of Brown County and are perfect for that family vacation you're planning. Our properties, Lemon Lift and Strawberry Fields, are right on the lake.

Frequently our guests rent both of our houses for family reunions and other large gatherings, and why not - the more the merrier! And bring your pets, because we accept them at all three guest houses. Guest houses are also available on a month-to-month basis Dec 1 through May 1 for those needing temporary housing.

Our properties range in price from $125 to $250 nightly (extra charge for additional guests) and children under 13 stay for free. (Ask about our mid-week and off-season specials!)

Both of our popular housing retreats are conveniently located just 11 miles from Nashville's shops, restaurants, and the Brown County State Park, and the same distance from the diverse nightlife and excitement of Monroe County and Bloomington, home of Indiana University.

Lake Lemon is Indiana's best kept secret destination for family vacations. Plan your next vacation with us and find out why!
