    - question: Do you allow pets?
      answer: Pets are allowed at all of our houses, but we ask guests to clean up pet hair and other detritus during their visit. Bring your pet, as we promise they'll have as great a time exploring Lake Lemon as you will!
    - question: Are any of your properties log cabins?
      answer: All three of our properties are lake community guest houses, but none are log cabins. While Lake Lemon offers our guests a scenic getaway, we work to ensure that each of our guest houses contain many of the modern conveniences and luxuries our guests want and deserve.
    - question: What do I need to bring for our vacation?
      answer: Bring food and drink, suntan lotion, cameras and movies - we provide everything else you'll need, including bed and bath linens, grills, and cooking/eating utensils.
    - question: Are there any restaurants and entertainment nearby?
      answer: Yes! The Port Hole Bar & Restaurant is within walking distance of all our guest houses, and their catfish and burgers are popular with locals and tourists. The Port Hole is open for lunch and dinner. Just a few miles away is the Butler Winery, where tourists can enjoy tasty snacks and wine from the comfort of a large, beautifully covered deck that overlooks the winery's pond and vineyards.  As for other dining and entertainment options, all of our properties are conveniently located just 11 miles from Nashville's restaurants, shops, live shows and the Brown County State Park, and the same distance from Indiana University and Bloomington's ethnic cuisine, theaters, and diverse entertainment.
    - question: What makes your lake side guest houses a popular destination?
      answer: Several things! We accept pets, Lake Lemon offers beautiful scenery and solitude, we cater to all sized families, particularly those with children, our guest houses offer many of the same amenities as the more expensive lodging establishments, but at much less the price, and we are less than a full-day drive from several Midwestern cities.
